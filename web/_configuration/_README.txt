Client configuration files seem to only be used within the payment processing and RTPC postback processing
(webpay directory)




The configuration files in this directory are used ONLY when the application is deployed, the directory
_configuration is expected to be in the context/application root directory. For development only any
changes will need to occur in the act_webdev/_configuration directory files, not this 
act_webdev/duc_sit/_configuration directory.
